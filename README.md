# Project Conclave - A Video Game Item Collection Tracker and Dependency Explorer

![Conclave project icon](images/conclave.png)

> _con·​clave_, noun, from Latin _con_ ("with") + _claves_ ("keys")

Item tracker for a number of games, vanilla and randomized.

Please report any issues you may find [on Github!](https://github.com/mileswest07/project-conclave/issues)

## Item Tracker instructions

Left and right clicks will toggle the icons. For standalone items, this will activate and deactivate them. For numbered counters, left click will increment and right click with decrement the numbers.

Some items will have "progressive upgrades" or milestones after activation; these are depicted by up and down arrows on the side of the image. Left click will upgrade the item, and right click will downgrade. Some items have multiple progression stages.

Middle click, if you have it, will toggle some overlaid icons, depending on the game and the item. For some icons this will display a sub-icon marking the collection of a hint or triggering of item collection event at the specified location. For select few items, this will toggle the item with a secondary form of that item (depicted by a ? icon).

Upon loading of the page, you can specify the configurations you'd like to use for tracking. Clicking the Ready button will generate a new page where those settings are saved to the address bar, so you can copy-and-paste the URL for loading in your browser at any time. (Note that at this time, the actual tracking of items are not saved locally; refreshing the browser will lose your progress! This will be addressed in the near future.)

Configuration options include the ability to display a timer and item collection percentages. Clicking on the timer will start it and stop it. The Reset button will clear it. (This option is currently disabled if Randomizer Mode is selected, and will be restored in the near future.)

The option for Randomizer Mode will display a table of games for selection. This consolidates randomizers with crossrandomizers and multiworld tracking. Select which games you'd like to track manually, or select from a few presets.

There are three graphical styles available for Metroid games, and one for Zelda games, at this time. This may change in the future.

## Dependency Explorer

Currently not ready for use, and has been disabled. This is intended to be the next major upgrade of the tracker.

## Development

This project is meant to run on an internet browser. So far the tested browsers include Firefox and Chrome. Styling issues can be submitted as tickets and will be addressed accordingly.

This platform reads a JSON file local to the server. To test it locally, make sure Node, NPM, and NPX are globally installed, then simply spin up a local server using:

```
$ npx http-server --proxy http://localhost:8080
```
